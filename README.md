# covid_sim 19/4/2020

# This script is a modification of the baseline scenario model presented in Hellewell et al., Lancet Global Health, 2020 (https://github.com/cmmid/ringbp) that explores the modification of the delay_scale and delay_shape parameters
# These modify the original delay parameter (time between a case becoming symptomatic to isolation) to a median of 0.75 days, 1 day and 1.5 days (assuming a Weibull distribution).
# the script will require installing the package ringbp as provided in the original link.
